Solo Defense
==========

This is my first Android game.  Solo Defense is the first game I write in every new language that I learn.  It's an exercise in getting something a little bit more complicated than `Hello World` up and running.  The game has not been updated since Android 2.3 and has few modern font issues, but is still very playable and has a large Android user base. 


###Goals
